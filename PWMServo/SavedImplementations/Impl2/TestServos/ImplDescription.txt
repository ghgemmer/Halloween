Verified this code short of the servo detach functionality. 
Only verified for Meag 2560
Uses hardware lookup table servoHdwrCntrlInfo[SERVO_MAX_NUM_PINS] which uses a pin index to get the associated timer hardware info as follows:
Registers (tccrA, tccrB, ocrA, ocrB, ocrC, ocr for pin
Method set clr mask for a given register and given operation (attachTccrnaClrMsk, attachTccrnaSetMsk, seizeTimerTimsknClrMsk, seizeTimerTimsknSetMsk, etc)

Then the class methods attach, detach, seizeTimer, etc set and clear the indicated bits in the appropriate register using those set and clear masks. 

servoInfo[SERVO_MAX_NUM_PINS] keeps track of a pin being attached or not to know if need to seize the timer associated with that pin
