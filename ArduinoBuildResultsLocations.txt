To find the build results location (if not changed by overriding them in the config files), simply
turn on in the IDE preferences menu item verbose output during compile.
Then compile the sketch and see in the output window 
you will see somewhere in the first few lines ...... -build-path <path>
Typically as a default is shows up at C:\Users\GregG\AppData\Local\Temp\arduino_build_nnnnnn

If you want to change the build results location you can modify the preferences.txt file the IDE shows a url to
and then add the line for example

build.path=<path to the folder the build should be performed in>

Important Note: You must create this empty folder yourself now as Arduino wonâ€™t and will give errors.
